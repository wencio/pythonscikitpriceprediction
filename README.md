Summary:

This code is an example of using linear regression to predict stock prices using historical data from Yahoo Finance. Here are the main functions of each part of the code:

Import necessary libraries, such as NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn, for data analysis and machine learning.

Download historical stock price data for a given ticker symbol (e.g., Apple) from Yahoo Finance and store it in a Pandas DataFrame.

Define the target variable (y) as the adjusted closing prices of the stocks and create example features (X).

Split the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

Create and train a linear regression model using scikit-learn.

Make predictions on the test set and calculate performance metrics like MSE and R^2.

Allow the user to input values for custom features.

Use the trained model to make a prediction based on user-entered values and display the result along with an explanation of what the features could represent.
